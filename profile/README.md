# Zoroastrian Digital Humanities

The growing field of Digital Humanities (DH) seeks to create and preserve human records in digital formats.

The aim is to :

- Promote knowledge, collaboration and dialog by enhancing access to wide-ranging resources from sacred scriptures and ancient inscriptions to virtual reality and graphic arts.

- To explore the promise of collecting open-source digital objects from Zarathustraâ€™s legacy.

- To build from these collected artifacts digital exhibits that are accessible to the public and to the community.
